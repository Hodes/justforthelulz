# README

This is my own blog application made with:

* Rails 4.1.2
* SQLite (oh yeah)

A few basic gems:

* Sorcery (auth)
* Paperclip (author avatar)
* Kramdown (markdown proccessor)
* Settingslogic (blog settings: title, ps)
* Friendly_id (post slugs)
* truncate_html (https://github.com/hgmnz/truncate_html)

It is still in development. I'm probably going to do:

* First steps (to create your user)
* Social networks sharing links
